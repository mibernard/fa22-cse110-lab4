1. outputs the length of prices since still in function scope
2. outputs discountedPrice since still in function scope
3. outputs finalPrice since still in function scope
4. outputs the array of newly discounted prices
5. outputs length of prices since still in block scope
6. scope error since declared with let and not in same block
7. will output the finalPrice with no scope error
8. it will return the discounted prices array with no scope error
9. scope error since i is declared with let in a different block 
10. outputs length with no error
11. error since array is const and it is being modified in the loop
12a. student.name
12b. student["Grad Year"]
12c. student.greeting()
12d. student["Favorite Teacher"].name
12e. student.courseload[0]
13a. "32"

14a. true
14b. true
14c. true
14d. false
14e. true
14f. true
15. == is a regular equality check and === is a strict equality checker. === will give false for comparisons of different data types while == converts the types.
16.
17. [2,4,6] since the for loop doubles every value inside the passed in array using the callback function.
